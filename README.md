    * Restarting daemon and k3s service to apply the new lines in the conf files using bash
    * Extracting the token file's content into a fact variable, to be used later in the slave installation
    
- 02_slave:
    * Running k3s install.sh with adjustment to set offline installation. 
    * The script adds env. variables needed to connect to the server:
